# iitc-plugin-CheckBanners
Try to detect issues on banners (like portal not available anymore)

## Requirements 
This iitc plugin will need that at least "Missions" plug-in be active.

The program will try to locate the banner on the INTEL by searching provided text as part of mission title
(it does not use any banner repository web site).

=> So at least one of the mission from the searched banner have to be seen into the "search banner" result

## disclaimer
it has been only be tested on the iitc working over Chrome on a PC (mobile version had not been tested)
